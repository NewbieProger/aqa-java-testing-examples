redis-fabric-example (!Draft!)

The story of this module starts when I got a task to release new module with steps for working with Redis through tests

The point of this fabric is that Redis has a lot of data types, and I tried to simplify it

I built this example, and later I consulted with my Lead QA, Developers from my team, and they said it's really cool, but it's over-engineering for test-lib, so I did much easier and released in our framework

So, I saved for the future, may be someday I'll come back and end this module
